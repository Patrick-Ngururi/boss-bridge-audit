# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 75](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L75)

	```solidity
	    function depositTokensToL2(address from, address l2Recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```

</details>



## L-2: Large Numeric Literal

Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation.Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 31](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public DEPOSIT_LIMIT = 100_000 ether;

	```solidity
	    uint256 private constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000;
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-4: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 59](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L59)

	```solidity
	    function setSigner(address account, bool enabled) external onlyOwner {
	```

	```solidity
	    function sendToL1(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, bytes memory message) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1Vault.sol [Line: 18](src/L1Vault.sol#L18)

	```solidity
	        token = _token;
	```

</details>



## L-6: State Variable Could Be Constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 31](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public DEPOSIT_LIMIT = 100_000 ether;
	```

</details>



## L-7: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1Vault.sol [Line: 14](src/L1Vault.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    IERC20 public token;
	```

</details>



## L-8: Unchecked Return

Function returns a value but it is ignored. Consider checking the return value.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1Vault.sol [Line: 24](src/L1Vault.sol#L24)

	```solidity
	        token.approve(target, amount);
	```

</details>



## L-9: Unsafe ERC20 Operation

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/L1BossBridge.sol [Line: 105](src/L1BossBridge.sol#L105)

	```solidity
	                abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transferFrom, (address(vault), to, amount))
	```

- Found in src/L1Vault.sol [Line: 24](src/L1Vault.sol#L24)

	```solidity
	        token.approve(target, amount);
	```

</details>



## L-10: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/TokenFactory.sol [Line: 24](src/TokenFactory.sol#L24)

	```solidity
